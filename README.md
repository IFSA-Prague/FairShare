### Goal
Our goal is to provide an app that helps individuals in shared living situations efficiently manage both expenses and chores by providing a structured, transparent, and fair system.

### Description
Users can log shared costs such as rent, utilities, and groceries while also keeping track of recurring tasks like cleaning, car maintenance, and household repairs. The app fosters transparency, accountability, and fairness by integrating expense and task management into a single platform, making shared living more organized and stress-free.
